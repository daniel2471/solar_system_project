Solar System Program

This Python program lets a user ask questions about different planets in the solar system. Each planet is stored as an object using a custom class, which keeps track of the planet’s mass, distance from the Sun and a short list of moons. The program can answer questions such as “Tell me everything about Mars”, “How many moons does Earth have?”, or “How massive is Jupiter?” It also includes simple input validation so the program doesn’t crash when the user types something unexpected.

To run the program, open the terminal in VS Code, make sure you are inside the project folder, and type:

python main.py

The program will then wait for the user to type a question. To stop the program, type “quit”.

I also created a separate unit testing file called test_planets.py. It uses Python’s unittest module to check that the planet data loads correctly and that some of the main features of the program behave as they should. To run the tests, type the following in the terminal:

python test_planets.py

If everything is working properly, the tests should finish with “OK”.

A separate test plan document (test_plan.md) explains the different tests I designed for the program, what they are checking and what the expected results are.

Below are the references for the data I used in the program. These follow APA 7th edition.
